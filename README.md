# Portfolio
This portfolio was designed and developed using React, Context API, Bulma, and JavaScript. It showcases my professional trajectory and features my projects hosted on GitHub.

## Technologies Used
React: The portfolio is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable components, making the development process more efficient.
Context API: The Context API is utilized to manage global state and provide data to various components within the portfolio. It enables easy sharing of data between different parts of the application.
Bulma: The portfolio's design is based on the Bulma CSS framework. Bulma provides a responsive and customizable layout system, allowing for the creation of visually appealing and mobile-friendly interfaces.
JavaScript: The portfolio makes extensive use of JavaScript to implement dynamic functionality and interactivity. JavaScript enhances the user experience by enabling smooth navigation and responsive features.
